## Customize auto responders with **merge tags**

### What are merge tags?

**Merge tags** are tokens placed around a field name.

Merge tags allow you to customize the response per submission.

## What does it look like?

Just like this...

```
{{ email }}
{{ name }}
{{ phone }}
```

Our **merge tags** use [Twitter's implementation of the Mustache template language](http://twitter.github.io/hogan.js/).
