Webhooks forward your events, making it possible to integrate with external systems.

Webhooks send standard HTTP requests with the POST method, along with the data from your form. The other system must accept the request.

When a submission is received into your bucket a webhook is sent to each URL configured in your bucket.

Sending your submissions to task automation frameworks, like Zapier, enables integration with many other systems like Salesforce and many others.
