## Can I export my form data?

Yup, click the “gear” icon next to your form name. Click the “Export” tab. You can either export a CSV to get a snapshot of the latest collection of submissions for your form. Or, you can use the FormBucket API to query your form’s submission data if HTTP and JSON are more your thing.

We send out webhooks for every submission we receive. You can use the email action in Zapier to send yourself an email.
