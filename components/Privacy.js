        <p>California Online Privacy Protection Act</p>
        <p>
          CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial
          websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach
          stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the
          United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites
          collecting personally identifiable information from California
          consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating
          exactly the information being collected and those individuals with
          whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy.- See more at:
          http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf
        </p>
        <p>
          According to CalOPPA we agree to the following: Users can visit our
          site anonymously. Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a
          link to it on our home page or as a minimum on the first significant
          page after entering our website. Our Privacy Policy link includes the
          word 'Privacy' and can be easily be found on the page specified above.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes: On our Privacy
          Policy Page. Users are able to change their personal information: By
          logging in to their account.
        </p>
        <h2>How does our site handle do not track signals?</h2>
        <p>
          We honor do not track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use
          advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.
        </p>
        <h2>Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?</h2>
        <p>
          It's also important to note that we allow third-party behavioral
          tracking
        </p>
        <h2>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h2>
        <p>
          When it comes to the collection of personal information from children
          under 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts
          parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's
          consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out
          what operators of websites and online services must do to protect
          children's privacy and safety online.
        </p>
        <p>We do not specifically market to children under 13.</p>
        <h2>Fair Information Practices</h2>
        <p>
          The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy
          law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a
          significant role in the development of data protection laws around the
          globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how
          they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various
          privacy laws that protect personal information.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take
          the following responsive action, should a data breach occur: We will
          notify the users via email Within 7 business days
        </p>
        <p>
          We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle, which requires that
          individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against
          data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This
          principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights
          against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts
          or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance
          by data processors.
        </p>
        <h2>CAN SPAM Act</h2>
        <p>
          The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email,
          establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the
          right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out
          tough penalties for violations.
        </p>
        <p>
          We collect your email address in order to: Send information, respond
          to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions. Process orders and
          to send information and updates pertaining to orders. We may also send
          you additional information related to your product and/or service.
          Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our clients
          after the original transaction has occurred.
        </p>
        <p>
          To be in accordance with CANSPAM we agree to the following: NOT use
          false or misleading subjects or email addresses. Identify the message
          as an advertisement in some reasonable way. Include the physical
          address of our business or site headquarters. Monitor third-party
          email marketing services for compliance, if one is used. Honor
          opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly. Allow users to unsubscribe by
          using the link at the bottom of each email.
